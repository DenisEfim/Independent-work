            <p>Cuba is a socialist island nation in the northern Caribbean. It is known for its white sand beaches and tobacco plantations, which are used in the production of the legendary Cuban cigars. The country's capital, Havana, is famous for its pastel-colored houses, 1950s cars, and a historic center that retains 16th-century colonial architecture. Salsa is performed in dance clubs, and magnificent shows are shown in the famous Tropicana cabaret.</p>
