                <p>An online game from the PUBG Corporation studio in the royal battle genre (when you need to kill other players, but survive yourself. - Approx. ed.). According to its plot, up to 100 people land on the island. They search for weapons and kill other characters. Over time, the map shrinks and players increasingly collide with each other.

                    Participants can choose how to enter the game: alone, in pairs, in trios or in a team of four. At the beginning, they jump out of the plane onto the island. Since the flight path cannot be guessed, the players jump whenever they want. After a few minutes, the territory of the island decreases - this speeds up the game.
                    
                    PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was released in March 2017. By the end of the year, the peak number of players exceeded two million, making it one of the most popular games in the world. She is currently ranked third.</p>

                <p>A mix of a multiplayer shooter (when many users play inside the virtual world. - Approx. ed.) from the first person and the royal battle. The game was developed by Respawn Entertainment. Suitable for Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch platforms.
                    The game involves up to 20 teams of three people. Before the start of the match, each participant can choose one of 16 characters. All players then board a dropship that flies over the map. At a certain point, they land on the ground and start looking for equipment.
                    
                    Apex Legends has non-verbal communication where players can signal their squad by showing cover, enemies, and weapons.</p>
